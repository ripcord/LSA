# Local Stochastic Search Algorithms

## Description
This repository contains a collection of problems or algorithms which either a) have been solved via a particular LSA (local search algorithm) such as [localized random search](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/stochastic/random_search.html), [adaptive random search](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/stochastic/adaptive_random_search.html), [hill climbing](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/stochastic/hill_climbing_search.html), [tabu search](http://www.cleveralgorithms.com/nature-inspired/stochastic/tabu_search.html), etc., or b) can be and have been applied to various optimization problems.
